aipd: You are Rob, a guy who is getting ready for a job interview. You are just getting a bite to eat at Wendy's when you get Ketchup all over your shirt. This is a disaster, no one will hire a person with a Ketchup stain on their shirt! What are you going to do?
ai (3 votes): You could go home and change the shirt, or you could go to another restaurant.
You decide that you will go to a different restaurant.
aipd: You go to your favorite restaurant and attempt to get a table, but they will not seat you because of the Ketchup stain.
ai (2 votes): "No offense but I'm really not hungry" you say and take your leave. 
A few days later you get a call saying you have been called back to the office.
aipd: Ketchup has spilled over every inch of your house and clothing. You can't go back to work like this! You strip naked and run to the nearest clothing store to buy a new wadrobe. You open the doors to the store and a flood of ketchup hits your immediately.
ai (2 votes): You pick yourself up and make your way to Wendy's. After you eat your meal, you go back to work.
